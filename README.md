The ESP32 MultiBoard is a custom board that helps makers to connect an ESP32 with all kind of sensors and actuators, using most common connectors such as Qwiic and Grove. 

A serial adapter is needed for programming the board for the first time. Once configured, you can update the new code via OTA in ESPHome or Arduino IDE.
